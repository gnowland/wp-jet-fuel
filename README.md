# WordPress Jet Fuel #

Propel your WordPress installation into the stratosphere with this multi-function plugin. The combined result of too many years making one-off WordPress deep-customizations and hacking hooks, I hope it brings inner peace and enlightenment to your world. ~(˘▾˘~)

### Installation ###

Come on dude, it's a WordPress plugin, you know what to do.

Option 1:
- Clone into your plugins folder and activate as usual (may I suggest wp-cli?).

Option 2:
- Download the repo as a zip file and upload to your site through the admin panel or FTP. Activate as usual.

### Contribution ###

Heck yea! Baby, we're better together.
- Refactor some gnarly code? Submit a PR.
- Write a feature addition? Submit a PR.
- Problems/requests? Make an Issue and I'll look into it ASAP.

There's no draconian PR standard, if I can't figure out something in your PR we can work it out together.

Don't be a stranger!
